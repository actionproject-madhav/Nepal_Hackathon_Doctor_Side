# VoiceCanvas — Full Product Requirements Document
### Hackathon: Nepal–US Hackathon 2026 / Mental Health Theme
### Version: 3.0 | Team Size: 5 | Status: In Progress

---

## OVERVIEW: Two Apps, One Platform

We are building **two separate but connected applications** that share data through localStorage (demo) and eventually a shared API (production):

| App | Name | Who Uses It | Core Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **App 1** | VoiceCanvas (Patient App) | Patients, caregivers | Draw feelings, hear interpretation, connect to a doctor |
| **App 2** | VoiceCanvas Clinic (Doctor App) | Clinicians, therapists | Review sessions, write notes, fight insurance denials |

They live in the same codebase (routing separates them) but feel like completely different products with different design tones, different data needs, and different goals.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Over **1 in 4 people with disabilities** never seek mental health care. The barrier isn't access — it's **articulation.**

People who cannot speak, or struggle to communicate due to disability, anxiety, trauma, autism, selective mutism, limited English, or cultural stigma face a compounding crisis:

- They **can't explain symptoms** clearly to clinicians
- This leads to **under-diagnosis** and poor clinical documentation
- Poor documentation leads to **insurance denials**
- Language barriers mean immigrants are excluded from care entirely
- Fear of denial stops people from **seeking care at all**

### Who is most affected

| Group | Scale | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Non-verbal / limited speech | ~7.6M Americans | Can't participate in talk therapy |
| Limited English speakers | ~25M in US | No therapist speaks their language |
| Immigrant workers (PEO-employed) | ~4.5M via PEOs | Insurance + language + cultural barriers at once |
| Children with autism / selective mutism | ~1M+ | Parents can't communicate how child feels to doctors |
| Solo mental health practices | ~180,000 practitioners | Denied claims, no legal resources to fight back |

**VoiceCanvas gives them all a voice — without words.**

---

---

# APP 1: VoiceCanvas (Patient-Facing)

**Route:** `/` → `/onboarding` → `/dashboard` → `/draw` → `/results` → `/find-doctor` → `/resources`

**Tone:** Warm, calm, safe, non-clinical. Never overwhelming. Feels like a trusted friend, not a hospital form.

**Design:** Soft backgrounds, large readable text, minimal words, visual-first.

---

## A1 — Landing Page (`/`)

### What it shows:
- Hero headline: **"Your drawings speak louder than words"**
- Subtext (1 sentence): *"Express how you feel — no words, no English needed"*
- Two primary CTAs:
  - **"Start Drawing"** → goes to onboarding
  - **"I'm a Clinician"** → goes to doctor app landing
- Small text link: "For Employers" → employer pitch section (same page, scrolls down)
- Background: subtle animated gradient (calm, slow-breathing orbs)
- No walls of text — judges should understand the product in 5 seconds

### Employer section (bottom of landing):
- Headline: *"Offer mental health care your employees can actually use"*
- 3 stat pills: $500B lost to untreated MH / 25M LEP workers in US / $2/employee/month
- How it works: Employee opens Gusto/Rippling benefits → launches VoiceCanvas → language + insurance pre-filled
- CTA: "Partner with us" (mock, just shows a toast "We'll be in touch")

### Status: Built (needs employer section added)

---

## A2 — Onboarding (`/onboarding`)

### Step 1: Language Selection
- Grid of flags + language names (show top 12, "more" expands)
- Languages: English, Spanish, Nepali, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Korean, Somali + more
- Selecting a language immediately switches all UI text to that language
- Stored in localStorage as `profile.language`

### Step 2: Camera Permission
- Show live webcam preview
- Clear explanation of why camera is needed (drawing, not surveillance)
- If denied: show fallback instructions, still allow mouse drawing

### Step 3: Gesture Calibration
- One by one, guide user through gestures:
  - "Hold up 1 finger" → green check when detected
  - "Hold up 2 fingers" → green check
  - "Hold up open hand" → green check
  - "Make a fist" → green check
- Visual hand illustration alongside webcam
- If gesture not detected in 5s: "Try again" with hint
- Builds confidence AND proves the tech works for judges

### Step 4: Quick Profile
- Name (optional — shown as "Friend" if skipped)
- Age range: Under 18 / 18–30 / 30–50 / 50+
- Communication level (used to tailor AI prompts + ElevenLabs voice style):
  - "I speak fluently"
  - "I can speak a little"
  - "I mostly don't speak"
  - "I cannot speak"
- Anything you want your doctor to know? (optional free text or skip)

### Step 5: Consent
- 3 bullet points maximum:
  - Your drawings are private
  - Nothing is shared without your tap
  - This is not a medical diagnosis
- Crisis line always displayed: "If you're in crisis, dial 988"
- "I understand, let's start" button → Dashboard

### Status: Built (needs language switching + gesture calibration step)

---

## A3 — Patient Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

### Top section:
- Greeting: "Good morning, [Name]" in patient's language
- **Mood tap row** — 5 colored circles (no text needed), patient taps one
  - Teal = calm, Yellow = anxious, Orange = frustrated, Red = distressed, Gray = numb
  - Mood saved to session log

### Caregiver prompt card (if parent uploaded a photo):
- Shows the uploaded photo
- Prompt below: "How does this make you feel? Draw it." (in patient's language)
- "Start drawing" button → goes to drawing session with photo as context

### Today's drawing prompt card:
- Visual icon + short text prompt (in patient's language)
- Examples: "Draw your safe place" / "Draw what's heavy today" / "Draw who you miss"
- Rotates daily, 5 prompts per day max

### Stress trajectory chart:
- Line chart of stress scores across all past sessions
- X-axis: dates, Y-axis: 0-10
- Color zones: green (0-4), yellow (5-7), red (8-10)
- If trending down: "You're making progress" badge
- If trending up: gentle suggestion to "Talk to your doctor"

### Past sessions:
- Thumbnail grid of past drawings
- Each shows: drawing image, date, short AI interpretation (1 line), stress score dot
- Tap any → expands to full SessionResults view with replay audio

### Footer:
- Crisis banner always visible: "In crisis? Call 988" (localized to language)
- "Find a Doctor" button
- "Find Free Care" button

### Status: Built (needs stress chart, caregiver photo prompt section)

- Parity violation category identified
- "Triggered: MHPAEA § 712(c)(4) — medical necessity documentation standard"

**Step 2 — Precedent Database Match** (auto, shows result)
- Filtered to specific insurer (e.g., "Searching Aetna cases...")
- Shows matched cases:
  - Case name, year, outcome (Patient won / Settled)
  - Relevance reason
  - Win rate %
- Overall win probability shown prominently

**Step 3 — Generate Appeal Letter** (doctor triggers)
- Doctor clicks "Generate Appeal"
- Letter appears with:
  - Patient name, insurer, claim ID

# DEMO SCRIPT (3 Minutes for Judges)

> *"Meet Raju. He's 28. He moved from Kathmandu to Dallas 8 months ago. He works at a warehouse. He hasn't slept properly in months. He hears his father's voice telling him he failed. He wants help — but he can't explain how he feels in English. And in Nepali culture, you don't talk about these things.*
>
> *But he can draw."*

---

**[Patient App — 90 seconds]**

1. Open VoiceCanvas → picks **Nepali** → UI switches to Nepali
2. Gesture calibration: "1 finger... ✓ 2 fingers... ✓ open hand... ✓"
3. Drawing session: draws a small figure, dark scribbles above the head, a bed at 3 AM
4. Holds open hand 1.5 seconds → canvas freezes → "Listening to your drawing..."
5. **ElevenLabs speaks in Nepali** — warm voice, 2 sentences
   - *[Pause. Let it land. Judges will feel it.]*
6. Stress score: 7.8 / 10. Crisis banner appears: "988 — available in Nepali"
7. Toggle "Hear in English" → plays English version
8. Tap "Find a Doctor" → Dr. Priya Sharma (bilingual, VoiceCanvas compatible)
9. Tap "Connect" → "Session shared with Dr. Sharma"

---

**[Switch to Clinic App — 90 seconds]**

10. Dr. Sharma opens Clinic Dashboard → Raju's card: stress 7.8 ↑, crisis flag
11. Clicks Session Replay → watches Raju's drawing build stroke by stroke
12. Right panel shows Raju's face — timeline bar annotated: "0:45 — suppressed emotion detected"
13. Dr. Sharma types notes in the notes panel alongside replay
14. SOAP note pre-generated → she edits one line → "Save"
15. Clicks "Submit Insurance" → selects UnitedHealth → form auto-fills → submits
16. "Claim Denied" — Reclaimant activates
17. 3 UnitedHealth precedents matched, 71% win rate shown
18. "Generate Appeal" → letter appears, citing Raju's 5 sessions as evidence
19. "Submit Appeal" → tracker: Submitted ✓

---

> *"In under 3 minutes: Raju expressed himself for the first time in his life. He heard his feelings spoken in his own language. He connected with a doctor. That doctor had everything she needed to treat him and fight for his insurance — without Raju ever saying a word."*
